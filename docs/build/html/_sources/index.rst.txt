GeneCover
=====================================

Wellcome to the documentation for **GeneCover**! GeneCover is a combinatorial method for label-free marker gene selection based on gene-gene correlation. 
It uses the minimal weight set cover to select a set of minimally redundant marker genes that characterizes the diverse correlation structures within the transcriptome.
